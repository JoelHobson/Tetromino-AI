# Falling Tetromino Game AI

An implementation of a typical falling tetromino game and a corresponding AI controller. 
I wrote this for a term project in my artificial intelligence course.

I had originally intended to do a comparative analysis of AI methods for
playing this game, but my ambition outweighed my cleverness (and I caught pneumonia).
I was only able to finish one actual AI controller, but I still managed an A in the 
course!

The project is mostly written in Clojure, with the exception of the GUI, which
is in Java (what else?). It's my first Clojure project, so the style is probably
a bit different from a long-time Clojure programmer, and it's horribly inefficient in
places. Still, I think I did a pretty good job for a first attempt...

There are a couple of bugs -- occasionally, the AI cheats and makes impossible moves. 
It also occasionally stops working - just restart the program to fix it.

Credit where credit is due:
The heuristics used for the algorithm (but not their weights) are derived from the article here:

## Usage

Run core.clj to run the game with an AI controller. To use the human or random
choice controllers, modify the players vector in the main method of core.clj. The
comments should make it clear what to do.
